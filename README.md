## Description

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

This AI can be used to produce poetry, stories or any other sort of text. The program first feches and reads a text, which it will use to create a model or in other words to train itself and educate itself on the structure and vocabulary of English language (or any other language). The bigger the text on which it will create a model the more cohesent a newly generated text will become. 

## Instructions

In order to use this program, one will need to downaload the contents of this GIT and put all the file in one dedicated folder. There are two to three failry easy steps that you need to follow to properly use this program. These steps can be viewed as '#' comments in the code itslef.

1. First comment tells you which file is used and you can change the text file by changing the path to the file in "path_to_file = tf.keras.utils.get_file('shakespeare.txt', 'PUT THE PATH TO THE FILE HERE')". 
2. The next step is to generate a model. To generate a model you will need to put '#' right in front of every ' """ ' before "This is the code for generating a text based on the constructed model" statement. After that you will need to run the program. The process of generating a program can take a while and the time it take will depend on your system's graphics card. 
3. After the program finishes creating a model, you will need to delete the previously placed '#' and do the step 2 for every ' """ ' after "This is the code for generating a text based on the constructed model" statement. You can choose the size of the generated text by cganging the amount of characters in num_generate variable.
